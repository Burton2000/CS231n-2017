These are my solutions to the CS231n Spring 2017 course from Stanford University http://cs231n.github.io/. 
I worked through all the assignments to improve my Python skills as well as my understanding of deep learning.

If you have questions with anything I'll be happy to try and answer them just post it as an issue.

## Completed
